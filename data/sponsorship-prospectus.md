# FOSS4G and State of the Map: Information for sponsors

FOSS4G SotM Oceania is a regional event that brings together the open source geospatial community. FOSS4G stands for 'Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial' and has been used since 2006 as a label for international and regional conferences of the Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo – [http://osgeo.org](http://osgeo.org)). OSGeo supports the development and adoption of open source geospatial technology. FOSS4G is part of the broader open source software philosophy (see [https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source)).

SotM is an acronym for 'State of the Map'. It is an annual conference organised by the OpenStreetMap Foundation, giving individuals and organisations a platform to discuss the development of the OpenStreetMap project ([https://www.openstreetmap.org](https://www.openstreetmap.org)). OpenStreetMap is a long-running effort to build a free and open editable map of the world. State of the Map conferences take place around the world at a local and international level, giving participants the chance to discuss the wider strategy of the project, tools that support it, and share case studies that can inspire others.

Given the alignment between these two projects, we have amalgamated them into one conference to focus Oceania's open source geospatial efforts. The conference also gives Oceania a link to global communities of developers and users; supported by OSGeo and the OpenStreetMap Foundation.

On the back of last year's success, we're moving the conference to Wellington, New Zealand, the capital of the country and a hive of geospatial activity.

### Attendee Profile

The inaugural FOSS4G SotM Oceania took place in Melbourne in 2018 and was an overwhelming success. All tickets were sold out with 248 attendees from 14 countries including many in Oceania, but also further afield from countries such as Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States. The backgrounds of attendees also varied and included spatial professionals, software developers, hobbyists, humanitarian workers, and government agencies.

Sponsors of FOSS4G SotM Oceania are thus given access to a diverse group that is shaping the direction of open source geospatial software. The conference is a healthy balance representing both developers of the software and the end users, though of course many fall into both categories.

In 2019 we aim to build upon this, broadening the diversity in terms of countries represented and the gender balance. We're also creating a more affordable conference ticket tier to include students and non-professional community mappers.

### What happens at FOSS4G SotM Oceania?

The conference is formally a two day event, with the program split between FOSS4G and State of the Map topics. The program for last year's event is viewable here. Like last year, we'll be running a workshop day prior to the main program and a community day following the main program.

The workshop day is an opportunity for professionals with deep subject matter experience and technical expertise to share their knowledge with others in a hands-on environment. Those attending the workshop day are able to interactively learn high-demand technical skills with expert practitioners.

The community day opens up the FOSS4G SotM Oceania community to a wider audience; members of the general public are welcome to attend. Last year's activities included a mapathon with the Australian Red Cross to improve public building and roads data in East Timor and a collaborative effort to import government data for public amenities into OpenStreetMap. Everyone is welcome to organise an event and encourage like-minded people to join them on the day.

### Why you should sponsor FOSS4G SotM Oceania

#### Exposure to a growing community

The open source geospatial community has been growing from year to year. More and more organisations are incorporating desktop GIS such as QGIS and GRASS or geospatial libraries such as GDAL and PROJ into their geospatial toolset. OpenStreetMap is also strengthening as a project with 40,000 monthly active contributors and major companies such as Apple, Facebook, Grab and Microsoft working alongside the community to improve the map. Sponsorship gives you prominent exposure to each of these players and allows you to show where your organisation fits into the community.

#### Support the development of open source geospatial

The FOSS4G SotM Oceania Conference is administered by a non-profit organisation, so any surplus generated from the conference is reinvested back into the community. This can include the support of smaller regional events and new initiatives that increase participation and the quality of contributions in the community.

#### Support an inclusive conference

Sponsorship in 2018 allowed us to lower the ticket prices for students and community members financing their attendance with personal funds. This is incredibly important for the sustainability of open source geospatial and the diversity of ideas at the conference.

### Who runs FOSS4G SotM Oceania?

The success of FOSS4G SotM Oceania 2018 illustrated the need for a longer-term governance structure for Oceania's geospatial community. A working group was established at the conclusion of the conference and tasked with investigating suitable entity to support the community.

At the time of writing the working group is in the process of forming a not-for-profit which will be known as [OSGeo Oceania](https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Oceania). This entity will support the long-term sustainability of the community and will formalise the relationship between the OSGeo foundation and the OpenStreetMap Foundation.

A [dedicated conference committee](https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/FOSS4G_SotM_Oceania_2019) has been established to focus on the delivery of a successful FOSS4G SotM Oceania 2019 in Wellington, New Zealand.

### Good Mojo

The Good Mojo concept was developed in 2018 to give people and organisations the opportunity to donate whatever they can afford with the confidence that their contribution is going directly towards conference initiatives.

The types of initiatives that Good Mojo aims to support in 2019 include:

- Funding a travel grant program that would enable those in under-represented communities with a financial disadvantage to attend. This initiative is particularly focused on citizens of Pacific Island Countries and indigenous communities in Australia and New Zealand.
- Organising networking events for under-represented groups.
- Initiatives to create a child-friendly conference.
- Reducing the cost of attendance for community members who are self funded.

In 2018 the Good Mojo program funded:

- [Travel grants](/tgp/) for 7 attendees representing Australia, Fiji, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, and Timor-Leste
- Catering for children attending the event
- Networking breakfasts for women in the open geospatial community; and travel grant recipients

Please contact the sponsorship team if you're interested in adding some Good Mojo funds.
