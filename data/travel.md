  - Women and minority genders        
  - Community development workers or students who don't have workplace or government funding        
- People who have "skin in the game":    
  - People who will use what they learn to positively impact themselves and their communities.        
  - People who already contribute to open communities, such as contributing to OpenStreetMap, or Open Source Software.        
  - People willing to volunteer at the conference or present a talk at the conference.
