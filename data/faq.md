## General

### Content Formats

During the conference days attendees will be able to attend sessions (with Q&A) and hands-on workshops, chat with experts and attendees at coffee breaks and, with the appropriate ticket, at the conference dinner.

### Livestream & Recordings

If you're unable to attend the conference in-person, you can still be part of the magic. All the sessions will be available for free on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbqmnF77HxLCmO9d7LrEbpg) as soon as possible after the conference. Workshops won't be recorded. Also, there's likely to be conference attendee chatter on social media during the event.

### Corporate sponsorship

Our sponsors make the conference possible! However, it does not influence the decision about which presentations are made, in any way: the process for picking presentations is blind.
