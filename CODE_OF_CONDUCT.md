### The Short Version

FOSS4G SotM Oceania is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks. Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the conference without a refund at the sole discretion of the conference organisers. The Code of Conduct applies at all official and unofficial events. Unofficial events include any location where attendees may be congregating.

### The Longer Version

Harassment includes offensive communication related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.

Exhibitors at sponsor booths or similar activities are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, exhibitors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.

Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Excessive swearing and offensive jokes are not appropriate for FOSS4G SotM Oceania.

If a participant engages in behaviour that violates this code of conduct, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.

### Contact Information

Conference organisers and/or volunteers will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.

### Reporting a Code of Conduct incident

1. To report an incident, contact any conference organiser or volunteer, who will put you in contact with the appropriate person to help you. You can also send an email to [admin@foss4g-oceania.org](mailto:admin@foss4g-oceania.org). All of our conference volunteers are informed of the Code of Conduct policy and procedure for handling incidents at the conference.

2. When reporting the event, try to include as much information as available, but do not interview people about the incident â€“ the conference volunteer will assist you in writing the report/collecting information. The important information consists of:
  - Date/time and location of the incident
  - Identity of victims, responsible individuals, and witnesses, including names & contact details where possible.
  - A description of the incident

3. If everyone present is physically safe, organisers will involve law enforcement or security only at a victim's request. If you feel your safety is in jeopardy, please do not hesitate to contact the police by dialling 111. If you do not have a mobile phone, you can simply ask a conference volunteer or organiser.
